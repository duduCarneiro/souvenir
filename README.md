# 👨‍💻 About

This was the final project presented on [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) 🔔! 
<br>
> *"Building an Airbnb clone from scratch in just five days is one of the most challenging and enjoyable moments of the entire bootcamp!⠀That’s the first time the students code in teams, learning to collaborate on Github using pull requests and deploying their apps on Heroku, using the same workflow as successful startups." (Le Wagon)*

Made from scratch. A mobile-first app. Designed, implemented, and shipped to production, coded in Ruby on Rails.
In our project, we developed a web app where the users can easily get a car for just an hour or for a few days. As in the Airbnb concept, it allows anyone to create a free account so they can list their vehicles and rent unique cars anywhere in the world.

The map on the right side shows all options pinned on their actual locations. 
Finally, after you choose a car and click on it, you will be redirected to the booking page to fill in a form with some information about your rent.
