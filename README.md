Made from scratch. A mobile-first app. Designed, implemented, and shipped to production, coded in Ruby on Rails.
Our web app is a simple way to organize and remember experiences in life. It allows the user to keep memories stored in a safe and easy way to access, since they can navigate through time and space to find one.
