Made from scratch. A mobile-first app. Designed, implemented, and shipped to production, coded in Ruby on Rails.
Our web app is a simple way to organize and remember experiences in life. It allows the user to keep memories stored in a safe and easy way to access, since they can navigate through time and space to find one.

## 🚀 Get started

you can access the app on: [souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com/](https://souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com/) 🚙. <br>
you can watch the demo of the product on: [Demo Day](https://youtu.be/Gsaq3tMb18o?t=771) 

## ✍️ Usage and examples

After the login, you can count on Dr. Brown's avatar at the bottom right to help you navigate through the app. 

On the home page, you will find a search bar where is possible to input a location, a specific date or both queries to be searched. It will list all the results associated with that. Let´s assume you are looking for your memories in Paris in 2019. The map at the top shows all memories pinned on their actual locations. Bellow they are showed by album:

</p>
If you choose one and click on it, you will be redirected to that album.

<br>
<br>

When you have something new to add, you just have to click on the plus button that redirects you to another page where it is possible to add a new memory, with location and pictures.
