Made from scratch. A mobile-first app. Designed, implemented, and shipped to production, coded in Ruby on Rails.
Our web app is a simple way to organize and remember experiences in life. It allows the user to keep memories stored in a safe and easy way to access, since they can navigate through time and space to find one.

## 🚀 Get started

you can access the app on: [souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com](https://souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com/) 🚙. <br>
you can watch the demo of the product on: [Demo Day](https://youtu.be/Gsaq3tMb18o?t=771) 

## ✍️ Usage and examples

After the login (Fake "log in" with user `ze@ninguem.com` and password `123456`), you can count on Dr. Brown's avatar at the bottom right to help you navigate through the app. 

On the home page, you will find a search bar where is possible to input a location, a specific date or both queries to be searched. It will list all the results associated with that. Let´s assume you are looking for your memories in Paris in 2019. The map at the top shows all memories pinned on their actual locations. Bellow they are showed by album:

</p>
If you choose one and click on it, you will be redirected to that album.

<br>
<br>

When you have something new to add, you just have to click on the plus button that redirects you to another page where it is possible to add a new memory, with location and pictures.
